# AI Generated Text Detection
AI-generated text detection is a complex problem. In this repo, we publish a dataset which is inclusive of text observations in which evasion techniques have been further applied after generating from LLMs and different experimentation
notebooks to build a robust AI detector on the basis of handcrafted linguisitic features and supervised machine learning algorithms.
