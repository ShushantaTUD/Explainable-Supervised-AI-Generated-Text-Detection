Here\\u2019s the paragraph with synonyms replacing the original words while preserving the overall meaning:\\n\\n\\\"Well, I haven't precisely investigated this inquiry, but I can provide you my best estimation. So, \\\"The Last Kingdom\\\" is a fictional series rooted in history, but it\\u2019s not necessarily an exact representation of every detail. That being said, I do know that during the era in which the series is set (9th century AD), communication and commerce between Wessex (an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in what is now southern England) and continental Europe would have been restricted due to the political and cultural obstacles of the time.\\n\\nFirst off, Wessex was merely one of several kingdoms in what is now England, and each kingdom had its own monarch and administration. This made it challenging for any single kingdom to forge diplomatic or trade connections with other nations or regions. Moreover, the Vikings (who are the primary adversaries in the series) were actively raiding and plundering coastal settlements throughout Europe, which would have complicated trade and communication even further.\\n\\nAdditionally, Europe during this period was not a cohesive continent, but rather a collection of smaller kingdoms and territories with their own distinct cultures, languages, and traditions. This made it difficult for diplomats and traders to converse and negotiate with rulers and officials outside of their own area.\\n\\nSo, in summary, while there may have been some restricted communication and trade between Wessex and continental Europe during the 9th century AD, it likely would have been a strenuous and perilous endeavor due to the political and cultural limitations of the time.\\\"\",\n          \"breeding is generally not possible because the offspring produced would not be able to reproduce and have offspring of their own this is because the reproductive systems of different species are not compatible and their offspring would not have the necessary reproductive organs to produce offspring of their own\",\n          \"Okay , so I think everyone is different .
